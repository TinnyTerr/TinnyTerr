## About Me

Hi! I'm a developer passionate about automation, coding, and optimizing workflows. I enjoy solving problems with code, building efficient systems, and working on interesting projects.

- 🔧 I work with JS, TS, tiny bit of C# (not nearly enough).
- 🧠 Currently, I'm focusing on CS at school as a Higher.

## My Projects

Currently, trying to beef up my portfolio however only got the one:

**Description**: A simple and powerful logger for both commonjs and es6 standards. 

## Thanks for visiting! 😄
